# bash

## `passwordless-sudo.bash`

[i can never remember the syntax for setting up passwordless sudo,](https://charlesthomas.dev/blog/automating-even-when-its-easy-or-why-cant-i-remember-the-syntax-for-password-less-sudo-2024-11-03/)
so i wrote a script to do it for me.

it can take a username as an arg,
but defaults to the output of `whoami`

## `repo-topics.bash`

this was a throw-away script i wrote
([blog post here about why](https://charlesthomas.dev/blog/automating-docs-by-abusing-github-repo-topics-2024-10-10/)),
but it has useful stuff in it including:

1. `case` statements
2. `read`-ing user input
3. `function`s
