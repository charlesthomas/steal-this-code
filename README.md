# What is this repo?

Numerous times in my career I've written a useful piece of code I'd like to be able to refer back to later, but I can't because I've changed jobs and the code isn't open and I don't have access to it anymore.

The goal of this repo is to house useful code patterns I will write & publish here first in the open. Then when I need it for work I'm re-implementing FOSS code, rather than the other way around.
